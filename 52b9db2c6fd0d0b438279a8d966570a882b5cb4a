Session Prompts:

1. "In the lambda directory, we want to create a Go 1.24 based AWS Lambda using the AWS Go SDK v2 on provided.al2023..."
   - Created Go Lambda for Stytch RBAC policy CRUD operations with ARM64 architecture

2. "For 1, 1.24 is available. Look at https://go.dev/doc/devel/release..."
   - Confirmed Go 1.24 availability and proceeded with implementation

3. "Great. Now the directory called 'terraform', build the terraform we would need to build and deploy the lambda..."
   - Created complete Terraform infrastructure for Lambda deployment

4. "For 1, Sorry. That was a typo. There is not dynamo table. Disregard..."
   - Clarified no DynamoDB needed, path pattern /rbacpolicy/*, health check /health

5. "ok, don't use a makefile."
   - Removed Makefile from Terraform directory

6. "ok. please plan and deploy the terraform. Troubleshoot any issues."

7. "Ok. Now, check the endpoint to make sure that all CRUD operations are successful"

9. "That is 100% wrong. All test environments match to a prod id'd workspace..."
   - Corrected understanding about workspace IDs

10. "Why are you trying to use an API url? The library examples do not use one."

    - Confirmed management.stytch.com endpoint usage

12. "Ok, I figured it out. You need a separate workspace_key and secret to access to management api..."
    - Updated to use correct Management API credentials
